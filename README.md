# Youtube Data ETL 

This dataset provides a daily record of YouTube's top trending videos, selected based on user interactions such as views, shares, comments, and likes rather than overall view count. It includes data from multiple regionsâ€”initially covering the US, GB, DE, CA, and FR, later expanded to include RU, MX, KR, JP, and IN.

Each region's data is stored separately and contains key video attributes like title, channel name, publish time, tags, views, likes, dislikes, description, and comment count. The dataset also features a category_id field, with category details available in an accompanying JSON file.

The data was collected using the YouTube API and has been structurally improved for better usability. For details on specific columns, refer to the column metadata.
