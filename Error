In Athena, you can use SerDe libraries to deserialize JSON data. Deserialization converts the JSON data so that it can be serialized (written out) into a different format like Parquet or ORC.

Hive JSON SerDe
OpenX JSON SerDe
Amazon Ion Hive SerDe

Note
The Hive and OpenX libraries expect JSON data to be on a single line (not formatted), with records separated by a new line character.
